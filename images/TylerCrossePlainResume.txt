IÕm a resourceful web developer excited by building pragmatic features that enrich and streamline user experience. When IÕm not attending hackathons or teaching other community members how to code, IÕm on a bike, a mountain, an airplane, or buried in a good book.SKILLS   FRONT END   - Javascript | ES6 | underscore / lodash | AJAX / JSON | Angular | React | D3 | SASS | CSS | HTML | jQuery | Bootstrap | Gulp | Webpack | Rspec | Jasmine | Capybara   BACK END   - Node | Express | Ruby | Rails | Sinatra | SQL | PostgreSQL | ActiveRecord | MongoDB | Mongoose | AWS S3 & EC2 | Digital Ocean   OTHER   - OOP | Test-Driven Dev. | MVC Pattern | Version Control | Git / Github | Agile Development | Scrum | API Integration | Responsive Design | Photoshop | Illustrator | Sketch | Arduinos 3D Printing | MatlabEXPERIENCE   WEB DEVELOPMENT IMMERSIVE JUNIOR INSTRUCTOR   General Assembly | Washington DC | 2016   - Taught 80+ hours of material on common best practices in object-oriented programming.
